              Brian Kimball is an engineer with knowledge of networking and
              development. He has a passion for Open Source application
              development. He combines that with the experience of working an MSP
              and CSP.

              Brian was trained in college as a graphic designer and web
              developer. That put him in position to work at an IT company. While
              there he worked his way up from helpdesk to a systems engineer. As
              the company grew, they introduced cloud services in which Brian
              helped build and was the lead technical resource. His passion for
              development remained and Brian continues to work in all areas of IT.
              When he says full-stack, he means he racked the server and
              configured the network his applications are running on.

              time, he enjoys Star Wars, the Ravens and the Baltimore Orioles.
