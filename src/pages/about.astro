              Brian Kimball operates at the intersection of infrastructure and
              code. With a deep foundation in both networking and software
              development, he brings a holistic "systems thinking" approach to
              every project. His background spans Managed Service Providers
              (MSP) and Cloud Service Providers (CSP), where he honed the
              ability to build resilient, scalable solutions from the metal up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally trained in graphic design and web development, Brian's
              career trajectory pivoted into the core of IT operations. He
              advanced from helpdesk support to Systems Engineer, eventually
              leading the technical architecture for a burgeoning cloud services
              division. This hybrid path has forged a unique skillset: he
              doesn't just write the application; he understands the network it
              traverses and the hardware it lives on. When Brian says
              "full-stack," he means he racked the servers, configured the
              VLANs, and <em>then</em> deployed the application.

              This portfolio serves as a catalog of his open-source
              contributions and technical experiments. Based in Delaware, Brian
              balances his engineering pursuits with family life as a husband
              and father of three. When not deploying code or configuring
              switches, he can be found cheering for the Baltimore Ravens and
              Orioles or diving back into the Star Wars galaxy.
