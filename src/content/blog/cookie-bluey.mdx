## Backstory

In early 2023, my girlfriend and I welcomed a new puppy, Cookie. Like most dogs, she is a very good girl. As we looked to buy a house and blend our families, I created this "Cookie as a Bluey character" poster to help the kids with the transition.

### Reception

Bluey is our daughter's favorite cartoon. As a parent, I appreciate its humor, short runtime, and valuable lessons. Our son loves the poster but has since requested a Fortnite version of Cookie. Our daughter has asked for a Barbie version. I might just create those too.
