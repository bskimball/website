## Hourly jobs on IBM i?

Many of my recent backend projects involve pulling data from an API and inserting it into a database or emailing reports. These tasks, often related to EDI and e-commerce, typically run as Node.js applications executed by a CL program. To process orders efficiently, these programs need to run every hour—or even more frequently.

The default Job Scheduler on IBM i (accessed via `WRKJOBSCDE`) allows administrators to execute commands daily, weekly, or monthly.

This standard scheduler offers limited options. In the past, I've seen
workarounds like creating multiple scheduled entries or writing complex CL
programs. With my Linux background, I prefer CRON jobs, which easily handle
specific intervals for recurring tasks.

### 5770-JS1: IBM's Advanced Job Scheduler

The Advanced Job Scheduler (licensed program 5770-JS1) has been available since IBM i v7r2. It requires a separate license and installation. You can access it via `WRKJOBJS` or add a job with `ADDJOBJS`.

The `ADDJOBJS` screen shares many fields with the standard scheduler, but with a
critical difference: it supports minute-based intervals. I can now schedule my
Node.js applications to run hourly without any workarounds.
