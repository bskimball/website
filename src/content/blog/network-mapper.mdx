## Preface

For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), gathering detailed network information during client onboarding is critical. This process is often time-consuming and non-billable. To solve this, I built a Node.js application to automate routine discovery tasks.

The concept: install the app on a Raspberry Pi, connect it to the prospective client's network, and initiate a scan. The app runs `nmap` to discover local devices and performs `whois` lookups on configured domains. It also queries DNS records (like MX records) to identify email providers. Finally, technicians can submit the gathered data to a central repository via a form.

### Technical Decisions

**Architecture**
I built this as a monolithic JavaScript application using ESM imports, with no server-side compilation step. It connects to a PostgreSQL database running in Docker.

**Stack**
I prioritized performance and speed.

- **Server:** [Fastify](https://fastify.io/), for its low overhead.
- **UI:** [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/), for its fine-grained reactivity and small bundle size.

This minimal full-stack JavaScript setup is highly efficient. The frontend consumes a REST API from Fastify, while WebSockets push live scan updates to the client.
