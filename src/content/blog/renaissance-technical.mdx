I recently pushed a major update to this website's design system, dubbing it **"Renaissance Technical."**

The goal was specific: avoid the generic "SaaS" look and the overly harsh "Brutalist" trend. I wanted something that felt like **Da Vinci's Notebook**—a blend of classical humanism and mechanical precision. It sits at the intersection of the organic and the engineered.

## The Design Philosophy

The core conflict in this design is **Circle vs. Square**:

- **The Grid (Square):** Layouts, cards, and dividers are rigid, schematic, and precise. They represent the "Engineered" side of my background.
- **The Human (Circle):** Buttons, avatars, and tags are perfect circles or pills. They represent the organic, human element interacting with the machine.

## The Workflow: AI as Creative Partner

This redesign wasn't just about CSS; it was an experiment in a new workflow using **OpenCode** as my harness.

### 1. Plan Mode & Ideation

I started by working with the **Gemini Pro** model in "Plan Mode." We didn't write a single line of code at first. Instead, we iterated on the _vibe_. I acted as the **Creative Director**, pitching abstract concepts ("Da Vinci," "Drafting Table," "Sonar"). The AI returned concrete art directions.

We went back and forth. I rejected the "Cyber" look. I rejected the "Landscape" look. We settled on "The Drafting Table"—technical schematics, compass arcs, and grid lines.

### 2. The Harness

Once the plan was set, I used OpenCode to execute. This is where the magic happens. I could describe a complex component (like the SVG background in the footer), and the system would build it.

### 3. Pro vs. Flash

I utilized a tiered approach to intelligence:

- **Pro Model:** Used for high-level reasoning, design decisions, and complex architectural changes.
- **Subagents (Interns/Flash):** Once the rules were established (e.g., "All buttons must be `rounded-full`"), I offloaded the tedious implementation tasks to faster, cheaper subagents. They audited the codebase, fixed border radii, and standardized colors without me having to touch every file.

## The "Creative Director" Role

This process highlighted a shift in how we build software. I wasn't getting bogged down in the syntax of `border-radius` or `z-index`. I was making **decisions**.

- "Make the buttons circular."
- "Change the footer to look like a blueprint."
- "Add technical annotations (FIG 1.0) to every page."

I acted as the conductor; the AI was the orchestra. This ability to quickly prototype, visualize, and iterate allows for a level of creative exploration that used to be too "expensive" (in terms of time) to justify for a personal blog.

## What's Next?

I intend to write more about this workflow. The ability to use AI to quickly prototype ideas is a game-changer, but it's crucial to remember: **the human makes the decisions.**

I am the Creative Director. The AI is the tool. And together, we built something that feels uniquely me.
