I recently pushed a major update to this website's design system, dubbing it **"Renaissance Technical."**

While I enjoyed my previous design, I felt the itch to switch things up and explore a new creative direction. I wanted to build something that felt less like a standard portfolio and more like a personal expression of my background.

In college, I studied Art, and I was always drawn to the **Renaissance** period. There was no distinction then between the artist and the engineer. Da Vinci didn't choose between painting and mechanics; he did both. I wanted a design that reflected that duality.

## The Inspiration

I was heavily inspired by the work at [AmpCode](https://ampcode.com), specifically their fearless use of bold colors and whimsical artwork. They proved that technical content doesn't have to look "technical."

I wanted to move away from the outer space aesthetic and shooting star motifs of my previous design. I wanted something that felt like a **sketchbook**—a place where the organic (art) crashes into the engineered (code).

## The Philosophy: Da Vinci's Notebook

The core aesthetic is **"Renaissance Technical"**. It sits at the intersection of the biological and the mechanical.

- **The Grid (The Engineer):** Rigid layouts, schematic lines, and monospaced "FIG" annotations. This represents the structure of code.
- **The Soul (The Artist):** Serif typography (`Tenor Sans`), organic circles, and deep, parchment-like textures. This represents the human element.

It’s a visual conflict between the "Square" (logic) and the "Circle" (emotion).

## The Workflow: AI as Creative Partner

This redesign was an experiment in a new workflow using **OpenCode** and the **Gemini** family of models. I've found Gemini to be exceptionally strong in creativity, making it my go-to choice for writing, design, and coding.

### 1. Ideation (Gemini Pro)

I start by working with **Gemini Pro** to iterate on ideas. I often use prompts like, _"As a group of designers, let's explore ideas to..."_ allowing us to brainstorm without writing a single line of code.

We explore different vibes, get feedback, and refine concepts purely at the abstract level. This creates a sandbox where I can act as the Creative Director rather than the implementer.

### 2. The Plan (Gemini Pro)

Once we settle on a direction (in this case, "Renaissance Technical"), I use Gemini Pro to formalize it into a plan. The goal is to create concise, actionable tasks that can be executed in parallel. This turns a vague creative vision into a structured engineering roadmap.

### 3. Execution (Gemini Flash)

The actual building is handled by subagents powered by **Gemini Flash**. These agents take the tasks from the plan and execute them. Flash is incredibly fast and accurate—scoring highly on SWE-bench benchmarks—which allows it to handle the bulk of the implementation work efficiently while I maintain high-level oversight.

## The Human in the Loop

This process reaffirmed something important: **AI is the brush, not the painter.**

The AI could generate the grid, but it couldn't decide _why_ the grid mattered. It couldn't feel the nostalgia for my college art classes. It couldn't make the decision to embrace the "Renaissance" aesthetic over a safer, more modern choice.

I acted as the conductor; the AI was the orchestra. And together, we brought this new vision to life, creating a design that I'm truly excited to share.
