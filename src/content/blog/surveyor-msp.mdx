## Evolution

This project is the spiritual and technical successor to the [Network Mapper](/blog/network-mapper/) tool I started a couple of years ago. It has gone through several iterations—briefly known as "Gatherer"—before maturing into **Surveyor**.

While the original goal remains the same—simplifying network discovery for Managed Service Providers (MSPs)—this version is a complete reimagining based on real-world usage and field techniques.

## Field-Tested Discovery

Surveyor is designed to be the first tool a technician runs when stepping onto a new site. It replaces the need to manually memorize and execute `nmap` flags or `nslookup` commands, streamlining the onboarding process.

Key capabilities include:

- **Stealth Scanning:** Utilizes techniques to evade firewalls and gather data without triggering immediate alarms.
- **RFC 1918 Discovery:** Automatically scans all local private network ranges to find devices across subnets.
- **Network Discovery:** Identifies other networks and potential pivots.

The tool is actively used by the MSP team at my current company, ensuring that features are driven by actual field requirements rather than just theory.

## Technical Architecture

We made significant changes to the stack to leverage a more robust ecosystem and improve maintainability.

- **Backend:** We stuck with **Wails** but rewrote the core network tools in **Go**. We still rely on the battle-tested **nmap** for the heavy lifting of scanning.
- **Frontend:** We migrated from SolidJS to **React**. This allows us to tap into a wider ecosystem, specifically using **React Aria Components** and **Tailwind CSS** for our design system.
- **Monorepo:** The project is now structured as a monorepo. This configuration allows us to share the design system across the application and the marketing site, and automatically updates the website version when we build the app.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project reached the finish line with significant help from AI agents.

- **Design:** We utilized **Gemini Pro** with a specialized frontend-design skill to architect the design system.
- **Backend:** **OpenAI's GPT Codex** was instrumental in writing much of the Go backend logic.

Surveyor represents a modern approach to tool building: combining battle-hardened binaries like nmap with modern UI frameworks and AI-accelerated development.
