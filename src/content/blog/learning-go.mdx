## Preface

I've been a web developer for roughly 20 years, starting with Macromedia Flash and Dreamweaver. My journey began with PHP and jQuery, moving through Ruby, Python, Node, and Elixir. While JavaScript/TypeScript is my favorite for its syntax and ecosystem, I know it's not always the best tool.

Recently, I've seen Go (Golang) heralded for its performance and Developer Experience (DX).

### What is Go?

    Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an
    era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.

Designed partially out of frustration with C++, Go offers a robust standard library, static typing with excellent IDE support, and no VM requirement. It excels in networking and CLI applications.

### What will I use it for?

After completing the website walkthrough, I found Go's syntax readable and intuitive. To accelerate my learning, I used this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/miguelmota/golang-for-nodejs-developers) which highlights syntax differences for Node.js developers.

I plan to rewrite my [network-mapper](/blog/network-mapper) app in Go. The original JavaScript application (Fastify + Solid.js) struggled with performance during `nmap` scans. I hope Go will resolve these issues.

**Plan:**

- **Frontend:** Solid.js (switching to Kobalte for accessible components).
- **Database:** Switching from PostgreSQL to SQLite for portability.
- **Backend:** [Echo framework](https://echo.labstack.com/).
- **Deployment:** Embedded Vite SPA within a single Go binary (using [this guide](https://dev.to/aryaprakasa/serving-single-page-application-in-a-single-binary-file-with-go-12ij)).

I will share the GitHub repo once I make more progress.
