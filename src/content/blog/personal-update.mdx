So, I've been pretty busy lately. I haven't written any technical content, but I have some things I am working on. My last blog post was in January about working with Go (golang). Since then, I married the love of my life in February. Then in May we welcomed our baby boy into the world. As you can imagine, we have been a little busy.

### What am I working on?

**Gatherer**
I'm developing **Gatherer** (formerly [Network Mapper](/blog/network-mapper)). Originally a Raspberry Pi discovery tool, I've pivoted it to a standalone desktop app for MSPs.

- **Stack:** [Wails](https://wails.io) (Go + Vite + React).
- **Why:** Go's standard library handles TCP/UDP communications more effectively than Node.js.
  I'll share a deep dive into the tech stack in a future post.

**Time Tracker**
Once Gatherer enters testing, I plan to revisit my [Time Tracker App](/blog/time-tracker). Built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com), this app simplifies time entry for warehouse and fulfillment center staff.

**Certifications**
After 14 years in networking, I intend to formalize my experience with Cisco certifications.

Thanks for reading, I hope to have some more technical content available soon!
