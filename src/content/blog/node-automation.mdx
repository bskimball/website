### Intro

Many business processes run on a schedule—MRP reports, EDI transactions, and database synchronizations. These tasks often run at night or at specific intervals to avoid disrupting operations. I frequently write programs to handle these automated interactions between databases and APIs.

### Why Node.js?

**Ecosystem & Packages**
The Node.js ecosystem is vast. Need to retrieve orders from Shopify or WooCommerce? There's likely a package for that. This availability significantly speeds up development compared to other languages.

**Training & Accessibility**
JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js have immense training resources. It's easy for new developers to pick up, and installation is straightforward on most operating systems.

### Current Landscape

I often replace legacy applications written in Lansa. When APIs change or older apps fail, updating them in Lansa is often difficult due to a lack of modern libraries (like OAuth or standardized API clients). Rebuilding these integrations in Node.js is often faster and more maintainable.

### Architecture

I typically write these as JavaScript applications using ESM imports.

- **No Compilation:** JSDoc provides sufficient typing without the need for a build step.
- **Structure:** Traditional MVC architecture, even without a view layer, keeps code organized.
- **Database:** I prefer [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) as a query builder, though I've also used [node-odbc](https://github.com/markdirish/node-odbc/) for raw SQL.

Since these applications handle sensitive data, they reside in private repositories. Once tested, a CL program triggers them via the operating system's scheduler.
