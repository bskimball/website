## Update

I really, really, like Go. It is not a challenging language to pick up. The standard library has most of what you need, and the syntax is easy to follow by design. I have been re-writing my network-mapper app, and Go is the correct choice for the server portion. The unfortunate portion is Go (nor rust) will run on the IBMi. Even though there is a PASE environment based on AIX, Go will not run. It has to do with mmap and other portions of the IFS. You can read more about it in this
[github issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45017). IBM is aware of this, and I hope in the future Rust and Go can run and be compiled on the IBMi. Until then I will use Go in linux environments and stick with Node or Python on the IBMi.

### The App
Firstly, I have not yet posted the code to GitHub. Even if I do, I will maintain a private repo. The name is changed to Gatherer and is meant to be used for quick network and MSP client evaluations. The server portion uses the [Echo framework,](https://echo.labstack.com/) which is a popular http framework. The application itself makes heavy use of scanning tools like nmap and whois for domain information. These tasks run in the background, and the app needs real-time data. I decided on an event-driven architecture and using web sockets to communicate from server to client. Client to server communications uses a rest api, I'm using GORM as the orm, so filtering is fairly easy using Echo and Gorm. I looked up some different Event pub/sub libraries but ended up rolling my own. The availability of channels in Go makes it pretty easy to have a Pub/Sub system.

I initially started the frontend using Solid.js as an SPA built with vite. I quickly reverted back to React. I like Solid but it's so similar to React that my IDE gets confused. It's also hard to beat the React ecosystem, so I thought it's best to switch to React. For react it's the usual suspects, react-query, react-router-dom, react-hooks-form. I decided to switch up my usual Radix ui config and try to react-aria-components. I am also using daisy ui so I have some components in css. I really like this set up. It cuts down on css classes, and the two play well together for a nice looking a11y app.

I may post some code snippets down the road, but here is the Event bus I am using. It is based off some examples in the Revel framework. I've isolated the to having separate "rooms" that I can broadcast and subscribe to.

```go
package events

import (
	"container/list"
	"time"
)

var rooms = make(map[string]Room)

type Room struct {
	Name        string `json:"name"`
	subscribe   chan (chan<- Subscription)
	unsubscribe chan (<-chan Event)
	publish     chan Event
	Subscription
}

func NewRoom(name string) Room {
	r, ok := rooms[name]

	if ok {
		return r
	}

	var (
		subscribe   = make(chan (chan<- Subscription), archiveSize)
		unsubscribe = make(chan (<-chan Event), archiveSize)
		publish     = make(chan Event, archiveSize)
	)
	room := Room{Name: name, subscribe: subscribe, unsubscribe: unsubscribe, publish: publish}
	room.init()
	rooms[name] = room
	return rooms[name]
}

func (r *Room) drain(ch <-chan Event) {
	for {
		select {
		case _, ok := <-ch:
			if !ok {
				return
			}
		default:
			return
		}
	}
}

func (r *Room) Cancel() {
	r.unsubscribe <- r.Subscription.New
	r.drain(r.Subscription.New)
}

func (r *Room) Broadcast(typ string, data interface{}) {
	r.publish <- Event{Type: typ, User: "go", Timestamp: int(time.Now().Unix()), Data: data}
}

func (r *Room) Subscribe() Subscription {
	resp := make(chan Subscription)
	r.subscribe <- resp
	return <-resp
}

func (r *Room) work() {
	archive := list.New()
	subscribers := list.New()

	for {
		select {
		case ch := <-r.subscribe:
			var events []Event
			for e := archive.Front(); e != nil; e = e.Next() {
				events = append(events, e.Value.(Event))
			}
			subscriber := make(chan Event, archiveSize)
			subscribers.PushBack(subscriber)
			ch <- Subscription{events, subscriber}

		case event := <-r.publish:
			for ch := subscribers.Front(); ch != nil; ch = ch.Next() {
				ch.Value.(chan Event) <- event
			}
			if archive.Len() >= archiveSize {
				archive.Remove(archive.Front())
			}
			archive.PushBack(event)

		case unsub := <-r.unsubscribe:
			for ch := subscribers.Front(); ch != nil; ch = ch.Next() {
				if ch.Value.(chan Event) == unsub {
					subscribers.Remove(ch)
					break
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

func (r *Room) init() {
	go r.work()
}
```

Any questions just hit me up!
