## Preface

A warehouse needed a streamlined way to track employee hours and tasks. They wanted to allow employees to scan badges or barcodes to log start and end times for specific tasks. I created an interface tailored to their workflow, including a filtering system that syncs with the URL for easy reporting and sharing.

### Technical Decisions

**Architecture**
I chose a decoupled architecture: a Vue.js SPA frontend communicating with a Laravel API backend.

**Backend**
[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) provides a complete, robust framework. Inspired by Rails but built on PHP, it enables a single developer to build full-stack applications efficiently.

**Frontend**
The frontend uses Vue.js and Vite.

- **Vite:** Faster and easier to configure than Laravel Mix or Webpack.
- **Vue.js:** Excellent performance and reactive state management.
- **UI:** Bootstrap 5, which integrates well with Vite + Vue and offers utility and component classes.

**Deployment**
I use Docker to deploy both frontend and backend containers to an Ubuntu server. A Traefik proxy manages access, with NGINX behind it to serve both applications from the same domain. While Traefik can handle this, the NGINX container improves portability.
