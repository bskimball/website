## Preface

This project demonstrates a modern full-stack application on IBM i, featuring a Feathers.js backend and a Vite-powered SPA frontend. I also used this project to test my custom Knex adapter for DB2 on i, [knex-ibmi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bdkinc/knex-ibmi). The frontend and backend communicate via WebSockets for real-time updates.

### Technical Decisions

**Backend**
The backend uses TypeScript and [Feathers.js](https://feathersjs.com/)—a toolkit for creating applications with authentication, WebSockets (Socket.io), and REST APIs (Koa). It interacts with the DB2 database using [Knex](https://knexjs.org/), a powerful SQL query builder that works well with TypeScript.

To connect Knex with DB2 for i, I developed the [knex-ibmi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bdkinc/knex-ibmi) package. This configuration allows us to scaffold services and hooks via the CLI, enabling modern real-time applications directly on IBM i.

**Frontend**
The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with TypeScript, Vite, and [React](https://react.dev/). Since Server-Side Rendering (SSR) wasn't required, I chose [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling. The UI uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), combining [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction) for accessible components.

**Development**
The frontend and backend reside in separate directories for easier management. During development, I run their respective dev servers in separate terminal windows.
