High availability (HA) ensures systems remain operational despite component failures. By implementing redundancy at both physical and logical layers, organizations can minimize downtime and enable seamless maintenance.

This guide outlines a fully redundant architecture designed for critical enterprise workloads.

## The Physical Layer

To ensure full redundancy, every hardware component is deployed with a companion device. Interconnections utilize distinct cabling standards for specific traffic types:

- **Network Traffic:** Blue lines represent standard TCP/IP communications (CAT5e or better) for management and user access.
- **Storage Traffic:** Orange lines represent Fiber Channel connections for high-speed, reliable data transmission.
- **Power:** Each device connects to independent power sources to prevent single-point electrical failures.

### Compute Nodes

Compute nodes (hosts) run the hypervisor (e.g., vSphere) on mirrored internal drives.

- **Virtualization:** Hosts form a cluster where HA software automatically migrates and restarts virtual machines on healthy nodes if a hardware failure occurs.
- **Capacity:** The cluster must have sufficient reserve capacity to handle the workload of a failed node without performance degradation.

### Storage Area Network (SAN)

Storage redundancy is critical. While software-defined storage (vSAN) is an option, physical SANs offer robust hardware-level replication.

- **Mirroring:** SANs utilize policy-based mirroring to replicate data across storage units in real-time.
- **Connectivity:** Compute nodes connect to SAN switches via multipath Fiber Channel. Zoning on switches ensures secure and redundant paths between hosts and storage arrays.

## The Logical Layer

The logical layer defines how data and requests flow through the infrastructure. This design decouples the service availability from the underlying operating system state, allowing for zero-downtime maintenance.

### Load Balancing & Proxies

All incoming requests hit the load balancer or proxy layer first.

- **Virtual IP (VIP):** Technologies like pfSense use CARP to present a single virtual IP address to clients.
- **Failover:** If the primary load balancer fails, the backup assumes the VIP instantly.
- **Distribution:** Traffic is distributed to application servers based on health checks and load metrics.

### Application Servers

Application servers (e.g., IIS) process the business logic.

- **Statelessness:** ideally, these servers store no unique local data.
- **Shared Data:** Any persistent content should reside on shared network storage or the database.
- **Updates:** Administrators can patch and reboot Server A while Server B handles all traffic, then repeat for Server B.

### Database Clusters

Data integrity requires stricter synchronization than application code.

- **Clustering:** MSSQL Clustering (or similar technologies) ensures transactional consistency between database nodes.
- **Sync:** Data is synchronously replicated to ensure the secondary node has an up-to-date copy at all times.

## Summary

This multi-layered approach to redundancy achieves two primary goals:

1.  **Resilience:** Hardware failures (switches, cables, servers, storage) do not interrupt service.
2.  **Maintenance:** Systems can be patched and updated during business hours without downtime.

**Note:** High availability is not a backup strategy. While it protects against hardware failure, it does not prevent data corruption or ransomware. A separate, immutable, off-site backup strategy remains essential for disaster recovery.
