## Life Update

So, I've been pretty busy lately. I haven't written any technical content, but I have some things I am working on. My last blog post was in January about working with Go (golang). Since then, I married the love of my life in February. Then in May we welcomed our baby boy into the world. As you can imagine, we have been a little busy.

### What am I working on?

Right now, I am working on Gatherer (name subject to change). Gatherer is the next iteration of what I once referred
to as [Network Mapper](/blog/network-mapper). The original intention was a discovery tool that can run on a Raspberry
Pi device. I have since decided to make it a stand-alone app geared specifically to MSPs. I also changed it from a
full on node app to a [wails](https://wails.io) app (go + vite + react). I felt Go had a better std lib for interacting
with TCP/UDP communications. I will have a more in-depth blog post about the technology stack.

When I have Gatherer ready for more testing, I intend to revisit my [Time Tracker App](/blog/time-tracker). This is
an App that uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com). Its goal is to allow a time entry system for people working in
warehouses or fulfillment centers.

Lastly, I intend to get some Cisco certifications. I have been working with networking and Cisco for 14 years. I
should probably have a certification or two.

Thanks for reading, I hope to have some more technical content available soon!
