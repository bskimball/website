## Backstory

At the end of 2022, we began the process of updating the BDKinc website. The marketing manager was to provide the
content and the Design Specialist was to create the designs. It was my responsibility to guide the team and build the
website. Even though I had other responsibilities, building the web presence was important to me. I started as a Web
Developer/Designer and building the website is a passion project of mine.

### Technical Decisions

The existing website uses Nuxt with a Directus CMS and is run in a Docker environment with a Traefik proxy server.
When I created this setup I was the only person managing the server, and building the website. As the company grew, I
knew we had to make some changes. One of the changes was switching from Nuxt to Next, the main reason for this change
was that I had started training employees to use React, as that is more prevalent in the industry than Vue. Other
reasons are SSR, the new App Directory, React Server Components and the ease of deploying to the edge. The
[website preview](https://bdkinc-bskimball.vercel.app/) is running on Vercel, and was an easy choice since they created
Next.js. I have used Cloudflare in the past and I really like it, but I also wanted to try something new.

Moving the frontend to the edge addressed performance and the ability to deploy from Github. It also moved the
responsibility of the proxy and web server to the edge provider. We still had directus as the CMS which had pushed a
new version. I wanted to upgrade it but wanted to give the marketing person a say in the backend. I suggested a few
different CMS. They ended up wanting Wordpress because their comfort levels. Using headless wordpress we would be
able to use Next.js on the edge and the content creators could use a platform they were familiar.

#### Long Term

One of the advantages of separating the frontend from the CMS would be easier integrations with other products. As
an example the "Meet the Team" page could pull the employee information from our Microsoft 365 environment. Allowing
users to only have to be updated in 1 place. Another strategy was to funnel all contact form and request a quote
information directly to our CRM. To give the sales people an easier way to sell packages, there is an opportunity
form that would submit opportunities to the backend software we used. This could all be authenticated using
Microsoft 365 authentication.
