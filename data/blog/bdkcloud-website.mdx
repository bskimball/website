## Backstory

There was a need to increase focus on the hosting part of operations. The idea was to have a site specific to
hosting that marketing could promote. I created the design and used actual images from the data center used to house
the equipment. It was just a landing page with a contact form.

### Technical Decisions

Previously I had been using Nuxt.js for websites. Nuxt is a great meta framework for Vue that provides SSR and
developer experience out of the box. I love the performance of Vue but there's just something about being able to
return JSX from a function that I like more than using templates. Since I switched to using tailwind, there was no
longer a need for the style section in Vue's SFC. React is more prevalent in the industry. As the lead training
resource, I thought it would be of benefit to switch to React and minimize the training footprint.

It's a website so SEO and performance are absolutely mandatory. I chose to go with Next.js for SSR and a React ui.
Next continues to be the easiest and most performant way to build websites using React. The website itself is
running in a Docker environment, with a Traefik proxy.
