## Backstory

At the beginning of 2023, my girlfriend and I got a dog. Her name is Cookie, and like most dogs she is a very good girl. This was around the time we began looking to buy a house, so we could all live together. To help ease into the transition, I made this Cookie as a Bluey character poster for both our children.

### Reception

Bluey is our daughter's favorite cartoon. As a parent, the cartoon does have some legitimately funny parts. The episodes are not too long and each one teaches a lesson. Our son, who is older loves the poster but has since requested a Fortnite version of Cookie. Our daughter has also requested a Barbie version. Who knows, I may create those as well.
