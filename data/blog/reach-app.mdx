## Preface

This was built as a proof of concept for a potential client. The idea was to build their customer database and
easily attach demographic data to their customer. This would be able to send courtesy emails on upcoming
anniversaries or birthdays. There are other services that do that now, but they wanted something that would tie into
their other software.

### Technical Decisions

The <strong>backend</strong> is written in Typescript and uses [feathers.js](https://feathersjs.com/). Feathers
provides an easy way to stand up a node server with a rest api and web sockets. It was easy to create services and
hooks allowing me to rapidly prototype CRUD operations.

The <strong>frontend</strong> is written in Typescript using vite and [react.js](https://react.dev/). SSR (server side
rendering) was not needed, so I decided to skip the complexity and just use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle an
SPA (single page application). For UI (user interface) I use the fantastic [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) which
marries together my favorite styling library [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and accessibility components in
[radix ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction).

The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is built on Docker. The database is MySQL and the proxy server is
[traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/). I've used Traefik in the past as it's easy to connect to docker containers.
