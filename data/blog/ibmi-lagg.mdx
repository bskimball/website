summary: Creating LAGG for performance and redundancy on the IBMi
---

## What and Why?

LAGG combines multiple physical interfaces together to act as one logical interface. Why would you want this?
Redundancy and performance. Many organizations have multiple switches, and one IBM server. LAGG allows you to plug
the server in to both switches decreasing the chances of down-time. While both switches are operational, all network
cables can be used simultaneously for the same ip address. This can increase the throughput of the networking to the
server due to the increase pipe.

## How?

Each switch brand has a different configuration for setting up LAGG. On a Cisco Nexus switch, for example, we use a
VPC (Virtual Port Channel) configuration. All managed switches have a way to create LAGG. On the IBMi, first you
need to identify which physical interfaces you want to configure as your LAGG members. Typically, you would have a
4-port network adapter, and the interfaces are labeled CMN03-CMN06. You can confirm these labels by issuing the
following command "WRKHDWRSC \*CMN" and you should see a list of all communications hardware. If you have multiple
network adapters, you can create LAGG between interfaces on each card.

The next step is to create your line descriptor. This can be done by pressing F6 on the WRKLIND screen or keying the
command CRTLIND. I typically use the WRKLIND screen and hit F6 to create a new line descriptor.

Inside the prompt for creating your line descriptor, you will need to define your configuration. Normally for
resource name, you would define one of the interfaces on the network adapter (e.g., CMN04). With LAGG you will
instead specify *AGG as your resource name. The next configuration item is the aggregate policy. The standard is
going to have to match with your switch configuration. Typically, we use Cisco switches and LACP, and on the IBMi we
choose *LNKAGG. If you have a standard ether-channel, then you will use *ETHCHL. The policy type is how the requests
are received by the independent interfaces. You will normally use *SRCDESTP and that is the most common. That last
part is listing your Aggregated Resources List. This is where you identify which physical interfaces will be used.

Once all configured, you will have a line descriptor that can be used just like any other line descriptor. You can
assign static IP addresses and routing as you would any other time. This just has the added performance and redundancy.
