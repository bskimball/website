NFT and Crypto have become incredibly popular. While I am un-sure of the longevity of crypto, I do like some of the
technology behind the idea(s). NFTs in particular have given artists a digital outlet to present their work. I enjoy
seeing the NFT profile pictures on twitter and some of the incredibly unique ideas people have. I decided to take a
stab at a profile picture.
