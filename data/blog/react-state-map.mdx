## Client Side Data State

For many years, I have held fetched data in state as an array. This does not have to be React state, you
could be using react-query or swr or some other data fetching library. Normally, I reach for tanstack-query
(react-query), but for simplification we will just use React state. I build applications that utilize web sockets or
server sent events for real-time updates. A lot of times we listen to an event and update the client state based
on that event.

An example of using an array to hold state:

```javascript
// react component
function ListComponent() {
  // our data state
  const [items, setItems] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    // fetch data and add to state
    socket
      .service('items')
      .find()
      .then(({ data }) => {
        setItems(data)
      })
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.service('items').on('created', (item) => {
      // on created append new item to array
      setItems([...items, item])
    })
    socket.service('items').on('patched', (item) => {
      // on patched map through items and replace item with the same id
      setItems(items.map((t) => (t.id === item.id ? item : t)))
    })
    socket.service('items').on('removed', (item) => {
      // on removed filter out the entry with the same id
      setItems(items.filter((t) => t.id !== item.id))
    })
  })

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

There is nothing inherently wrong with the code above. Maybe it's a bit verbose, but it should be pretty clear what it
does and what is happening. It certainly works, but it feels a bit awkward to map the entire array on a "patched"
event or filter on a "removed" event.

In ES6 the Map object was introduced. You can read the details on the
[Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map). A Map will
hold key/value pairs. You can use your "id" field as a key, and the rest of the item as a value in the pairing.
Below is the same example as above except we are using a Map instead of an array.

An example of using a Map to hold state:

```javascript
// react component
function ListComponent() {
  // our data state
  const [items, setItems] = useState(new Map())

  useEffect(() => {
    // fetch data and add to state
    socket
      .service('items')
      .find()
      .then(({ data }) => {
        // use the id as the key and the full item as the value
        setItems(new Map(data.map((d) => [d.id, d])))
      })
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    // listen for each event
    ['created', 'patched', 'removed'].forEach((event) => {
      socket.service('items').on(event, (item) => {
        if (event === 'removed') {
          // if removed, delete the key from the map
          items.delete(item.id)
        } else {
          // created or patched scenarios we just set the appropriate key
          items.set(item.id, item)
        }
        // set state with a new map
        setItems(new Map(items))
      })
    })
  })

  return (
    <ul>
      {Array.from(items).map(([id, item]) => (
        <li key={id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

The trick here is you have to create a new Map when the state is updated. So far, I like using this solution. It
seems to simplify the code. I don't have to map or filter the entire array to update or remove an entry. If you have
