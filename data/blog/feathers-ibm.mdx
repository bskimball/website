## Preface

I wanted to showcase a modern application built on the IBMi. It's using feathers.js for the backend server and has a
vite spa (single page application) frontend. I had also created a knex adapter for db2 for i, and I needed a way to
test the adapter in a "real" application. That adapter can be found on NPM [knex-ibmi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bdkinc/knex-ibmi) The frontend and backend
communication is done through web-sockets, and updates in real-time.

### Technical Decisions

The <strong>backend</strong> is written in Typescript and uses [feathers.js](https://feathersjs.com/). If you are not
familiar,
feathers is a toolkit for configuring apps with authentication, web sockets (socket.io), rest api (koa), etc.
It interacts with the DB2 database using knex. [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) is a "batteries included" SQL query
builder, and it nice to work with in a typescript environment. To be able to use knex with DB2 for I, we use the
[knex-ibmi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bdkinc/knex-ibmi). Once configured we are able to scaffold services and
hooks using the CLI. This allows us to build modern real-time applications directly on the IBMi and using the DB2
database.

The <strong>frontend</strong> is written in Typescript using vite and [react.js](https://react.dev/). SSR (server side
rendering) was not needed, so I decided to skip the complexity and just use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle an
SPA (single page application). For UI (user interface) I use the fantastic [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) which
marries together my favorite styling library [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and accessibility components in
[radix ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction).

The frontend and backend are in separate folders. They are easier to manage in that regard. When developing I just
opened to separate terminal windows to run the Dev servers simultaneously.
