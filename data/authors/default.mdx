Brian Kimball is an engineer with knowledge of networking and development. He has a passion for Open Source application
development. He combines that with the experience of working an MSP and CSP.

Brian was trained in college as a graphic designer and web developer.
That put him in position to work at an IT
company. While there he worked his way up from helpdesk to a systems engineer. As the company grew, they introduced
cloud services in which Brian helped build and was the lead technical resource. His passion for development remained
and Brian continues to work in all areas of IT. When he says full-stack, he means he quite literally racked the
server and configured the network his applications are running on.

This website is a collection of projects he has worked on.
Brian lives in Delaware with his wife; and their two kids.
In his spare time, he enjoys Star Wars, the Ravens and the Baltimore Orioles.
